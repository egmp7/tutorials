# Databases

A database is the data itself, collected together.

The first purpose of a database is to store data.

A second reason is to be able to access and query the data in the database. Querying means reading data from the database. Creating, reading, updating, and deleting data are database operations that we would usually like to be able to perform (CRUD)

A third purpose of a database is to provide an organizational structure for data
