# Representation of Binary Tree

First graph is a full binary tree;

Second graph is a complete binary tree;

Third graph is not a full binary tree and complete binary tree;

# Complete binary Tree examples

Time complexity of a complete binary tree is $O(log(n))$

# Max & Min Heap

A Heap is a complete binary tree

![Heap](/Algorithms/assets/heap.png)

# Insert Max Heap

![Heap](/Algorithms/assets/insertMaxHeap.png)

# Delete Max Heap

Only top element gets deleted,elements will be sorted this way.

Time complexity of deletion is $O(log(n))$

# Heap Sort

Time for insertion is $n\times log(n)$, Time for deletion is $n\times log(n)$, Total time = $2n\times log(n)$

$O(n\times log(n))$

# Heapify

Time complexity $O(n)$

This is faster than insertion which is $n\times log(n)$
