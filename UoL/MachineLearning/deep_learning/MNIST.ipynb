    "The neural network in this code snippet is trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Here are some observations regarding the training and test accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Accuracy**:\n",
    "   - The training accuracy steadily increases over the epochs from approximately 92.57% in the first epoch to 98.89% in the fifth epoch.\n",
    "   - This indicates that the model is learning to classify the training data more accurately with each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Accuracy**:\n",
    "   - The test accuracy is 97.97%.\n",
    "   - This means that when the trained model is evaluated on unseen data (the test set), it correctly classifies approximately 97.97% of the images.\n",
    "   - The test accuracy is slightly lower than the final training accuracy, which is expected as the model may not generalize perfectly to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Dynamics**:\n",
    "   - The loss (categorical cross-entropy) decreases steadily over the epochs, indicating that the model's predictions are getting closer to the true labels on the training data.\n",
    "   - The decrease in loss corresponds to the increase in accuracy, as a lower loss typically indicates better classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Potential Overfitting**:\n",
    "   - The gap between the training accuracy and test accuracy is relatively small, suggesting that the model is not significantly overfitting the training data.\n",
    "   - However, there is still a slight difference between the training and test accuracies, indicating some level of overfitting may be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the neural network achieves high accuracy on both the training and test datasets, indicating that it effectively learns to classify handwritten digits. The training dynamics show consistent improvement over the epochs, and while there is a slight indication of overfitting, the model generalizes reasonably well to unseen data."

    "2. **Loss Decrease**:\n",
    "   - The loss decreased from 0.1058 in the first run to 0.0671 in the second run.\n",
    "   - This indicates that the model trained for 5 epochs in the second run achieved lower loss compared to the model trained for 20 epochs in the first run.\n",
    "   - The decrease in loss suggests that the model trained for 5 epochs might be better at generalizing to unseen data or avoiding overfitting compared to the model trained for 20 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while the accuracy slightly decreased in the second run compared to the first run, the loss significantly decreased. This suggests that the model trained for fewer epochs in the second run achieved comparable accuracy while exhibiting better generalization or avoidance of overfitting, as indicated by the lower loss."

    "Similarly, in a computer program that's learning something, like recognizing pictures of cats, the learning rate is how quickly or slowly the program adjusts itself based on the mistakes it makes.\n",

    "If the learning rate is too low, the program might take a long time to learn and improve its accuracy because it's adjusting very slowly.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's experiment with different learning rates and observe the results on the MNIST dataset. We'll compile the model using the provided code snippet and vary the learning rates to observe their effects on test loss and accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpreting the results:\n",
    "- **Effect of Learning Rate on Test Loss**: \n",
    "  - A learning rate of 0.001 resulted in the lowest test loss (0.0671), indicating better performance in terms of classification accuracy compared to other learning rates.\n",

    "## Momentum\n",
    "Imagine you're pushing a heavy ball up a hill. At the beginning, it's hard to get the ball moving, but once it starts rolling, it gathers momentum. This momentum helps it keep moving even if you stop pushing for a moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of training a neural network, momentum is like the \"rolling force\" that helps the optimization process keep moving in the right direction. It's a value between 0 and 1 that determines how much the optimizer relies on the current gradient direction and how much it remembers the previous update steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how momentum works in training a neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gradient Update**: During each training step, the optimizer calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Momentum Effect**: Instead of updating the parameters based solely on the current gradient, momentum allows the optimizer to accumulate a rolling average of past gradients. This helps smooth out fluctuations in the gradient direction and maintain a more consistent direction of movement towards the minimum of the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update Step**: The optimizer then updates the parameters by combining the current gradient with the momentum-adjusted gradient. This helps the optimization process \"roll\" more smoothly towards the optimal solution, especially in the presence of noisy or sparse gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, momentum in neural network training is like giving the optimization process a bit of \"rolling force\" to help it navigate the landscape of the loss function more efficiently, leading to faster convergence and potentially better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "Sure, let's experiment with different momentums and observe their effects on the model's performance on the MNIST dataset. We'll compile the model using the provided code snippet with varying momentums and then observe the results in a table format.\n",

    "  - Increasing the momentum to 0.5 led to a slightly higher test loss (0.0726), suggesting that the model might not be able to converge to the optimal solution as effectively.\n",
    "  - Further increasing the momentum to 0.9 resulted in a higher test loss (0.0902), indicating that the model might be oscillating or overshooting the optimal solution more frequently.\n",
