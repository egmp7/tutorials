# Layer 1: Physical

## Analog Modem

- Modulate / Demodulate
- Converts digital signal into analog signal
- Connects via PSTN (Public switched telephone network) using POTS (Plain old telephone system)

## Hub 
- Concentrator / Repeater
- Takes electrical signal and replicates that signal out
- Hub is not common in modern networking

# Layer 2: Data Link

## Switch
- Utilizes ASIC chip (Application-specific integrated circuit)
- The ASIC chip allows the switch to learn when a device is on the network and devices are connected with the MAC address
- The switch is programmable

## WAP - Wireless access point

- Network bridge that connects wireless network segments with wired network segments 
- Only communicates with local networks 
- Common WAP: 802.11 (Wireless), 802.3 (Ethernet)

# Layer 3: Network

## MLS - Multilayer Switch

- Provides layer 2 switching devices services AND layer 3 or higher OSI model services
- Uses ASIC chip but allows to communicate outside a local network
- Highly programmable
- Expensive

## Router

- Most common device
- Connects networks together
- Uses software programming compared to the ASIC chip
- Finds the best route possible
- Fewer ports than a switch
