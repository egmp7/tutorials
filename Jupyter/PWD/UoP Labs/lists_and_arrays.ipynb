    "This lab will constitute practice with Python lists and NumPy arrays. If you've been struggling with Python data structures, this will be a good chance to refine your understanding. None of the tasks here will take more than a couple of lines of code (Python or NumPy tasks), so keep that in mind if you find yourself writing a lot of Python to solve a problem. Lots of code to do something simple is bad practice!\n",
